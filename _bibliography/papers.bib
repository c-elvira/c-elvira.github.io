	abstract = {We present new theoretical results on sparse recovery guarantees for a greedy algorithm, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), in the context of continuous dictionaries. Consider a sparse linear combination of atoms from a dictionary parameterized by some real parameters, for example, a combination of shifted versions of a basic waveform as in the context of sparse spike deconvolution. Currently, performance guarantees for greedy algorithms are typically carried out in the discrete setting associated to a grid of atom parameters, and based on, e.g., the coherence of the considered discretized dictionary \cite\{tropp2004\}. However, such analyses fail to be conclusive for grid-based approaches when the discretization step tends to zero, as the coherence goes to one. Instead, our analysis is directly conducted in the continuous setting. For atoms parametrized by a real parameter that are elements of the (infinite-dimensional) Hilbert space $L_2(\mathbb\{R\})$ of square integrable real functions, and such that the inner product between two atoms is the exponential of the negative absolute difference of the corresponding parameters, we show in the noise-free setting that OMP exactly recovers the atom parameters as well as their amplitudes, regardless of the number of distinct atoms. We exhibit a convolutive dictionary of exponentially decaying pulses for which the atoms have an analytic definition while their pairwise inner products have the prescribed form. The established guarantees rely on a proof technique which is the continuous equivalent of Tropp’s Exact Recovery Condition (ERC) \cite\{tropp2004\}. The proof exploits specific properties of the positive definite kernel between atom parameters defined by the inner product between the corresponding atoms. Future work will aim at characterizing the class of kernels for which such an analysis holds –in particular for higher dimensional parameters– and the compatibility of the guarantees with dimension reduction techniques such as sketching, which would pave the way to provably good greedy algorithms for compressive statistical learning \cite\{Gribonval2017\}. In light of the existing links between Tropp’s ERC and recovery guarantees for $\ell_1$ minimization \cite\{tropp2006\}, an interesting question is whether these guarantees extend to sparse spike recovery with total variation norm minimization~\cite\{Duval2015,candes2014\}.},

Here, the continuous setting means that the dictionary is made up of an infinite (potentially uncountable) number of atoms. In this work, we rely on the Hilbert structure of the observation space to express our recovery results as a property of the kernel defined by the inner product between two atoms. Using a continuous extension of Tropp's Exact Recovery Condition, we identify two key notions of admissible kernel and admissible support that are sufficient to ensure exact recovery with OMP. We exhibit a family of admissible kernels relying on completely monotone functions for which admissibility holds for any support in the one-dimensional setting. For higher dimensional parameter spaces, an additional notion of axis admissibility is shown to be sufficient to ensure a form of delayed recovery. An additional algebraic condition involving a finite subset of (known) atoms further yields exact recovery guarantees. Finally, a coherence-based viewpoint on these results provides recovery guarantees in terms of a minimum separation assumption.},

In this paper, we propose a new methodology , dubbed safe squeezing, to accelerate the computation of antisparse representation. We describe a test that allows to detect saturated entries in the solution of the optimization problem. The contribution of these entries is compacted into a single vector, thus operating a form of dimensionality reduction. We propose two algorithms to solve the resulting lower dimensional problem. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method to detect the saturated components of the solution and illustrates the induced computational gains in the resolution of the antisparse problem.},

	abstract={Sparse representations have proven their efficiency in solving a wide class of inverse problems encountered in signal and image processing. Conversely, enforcing the information to be spread uniformly over representation coefficients exhibits relevant properties in various applications such as robust encoding in digital communications. Antisparse regularization can be naturally expressed through an ℓ∞-norm penalty. This paper derives a probabilistic formulation of such representations. Anew probability distribution, referred to as the democratic prior, is first introduced. Its main properties as well as three random variate generators for this distribution are derived. Then this probability distribution is used as a prior to promote antisparsity in a Gaussian linear model, yielding a fully Bayesian formulation of antisparse coding. Two Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are proposed to generate samples according to the posterior distribution. The first one is a standard Gibbs sampler. The second one uses Metropolis-Hastings moves that exploit the proximity mapping of the log-posterior distribution. These samples are used to approximate maximum aposteriori and minimum mean square error estimators of both parameters and hyperparameters. Simulations on synthetic data illustrate the performances of the two proposed samplers, for both complete and over-complete dictionaries. All results are compared to the recent deterministic variational FITRA algorithm.},

Then the factor scores take benefit of an Indian buffet process prior to model the uncertainty related to the number of components.

    abstract = {Dans les modèles probabilistes, les méthodes d'échantillonnage   et les approximations variationnelles sont souvent utilisées pour l’inférence. Mais ces méthodes passent difficilement à l'échelle. Une  alternative consiste à relâcher le modèle probabiliste dans une formulation  non probabiliste et utiliser un algorithme évolutif pour résoudre le problème de minimisation associé. Nous proposons une analyse dite de Small-Variance  Asymptotics (SVA) du modèle bayésien non paramétrique de type Buffet Indien à deux paramètres qui apprend automatiquement un dictionnaire de taille adaptée. Cette  approche s'obtient en faisant tendre la variance de la  vraisemblance du modèle vers 0. L'analyse montre une interaction entre les méthodes bayésiennes et optimisation. Les résultats illustrent la pertinence de la méthode proposée.},

    abstract = {Dans un but de robustesse, un codage antiparcimonieux répartit uniformément l’information d’un signal sur toutes les composantes de sa représentation. La recherche d’un tel codage s’exprime naturellement sous la forme d’un problème variationnel impliquant une régularisation de type $\ell_\infty$. Dans cet article une formulation bayésienne du problème est proposée, impliquant une nouvelle loi de probabilité, la loi démocratique, qui pénalise les fortes amplitudes. Cette distribution est choisie comme loi a priori sur les coefficients de représentation, couplée avec une vraisemblance gaussienne. Les estimateurs bayésiens des coefficients de représentation peuvent être approchés à l’aide d’un échantillonneur de Gibbs. Cette méthode passe cependant difficilement à l’échelle et un algorithme de Monte Carlo proximal a été proposé. On discute une nouvelle façon de choisir et régler la loi a priori sur les paramètres de nuisance. Deux simulations numériques permettent de valider le réglage des hyperparamètres et la recherche du paramètre de régularisation.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is very popular to perform dimension reduction. The selection of the number of significant components is essential but often based on some practical heuristics depending on the application. Only few works have proposed a probabilistic approach able to infer the number of significant components. To this purpose, this paper introduces a Bayesian nonparametric principal component analysis (BNP-PCA). The proposed model projects observations onto a random orthogonal basis which is assigned a prior distribution defined on the Stiefel manifold. The prior on factor scores involves an Indian buffet process to model the uncertainty related to the number of components. The parameters of interest as well as the nuisance parameters are finally inferred within a fully Bayesian framework via Monte Carlo sampling. A study of the (in-)consistence of the marginal maximum a posteriori estimator of the latent dimension is carried out. A new estimator of the subspace dimension is proposed. Moreover, for sake of statistical significance, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based on the posterior distribution of the principal components is used to refine this estimate. The behaviour of the algorithm is first studied on various synthetic examples. Finally, the proposed BNP dimension reduction approach is shown to be easily yet efficiently coupled with clustering or latent factor models within a unique framework.},
